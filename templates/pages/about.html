## About CosmoTalks

[Home](/) &nbsp; | &nbsp; [Talks](/cosmotalks/talks) &nbsp;  | &nbsp;  [Series](/cosmotalks/series) | &nbsp; | &nbsp; [Usage Tips](/tips) |

This is a **work-in-progress** start on a database collection currently listing hyperlinks to over 1400 online talks by researchers reporting on their work on cosmology-related projects. The talks in this list were in general presented for an audience of other researchers working in the field. The data is gathered from (currently 29) diverse sources (called 'series') that have published talks from conferences, seminars, colloquia, workshops, course lectures, summer schools, etc.

This collection was started out of personal interest because no one site was found that comprehensively compiles such data from a wide range of sources. There are so many sources available that this represents only a fraction of the total that's out there; still, it's a starter attempt to extend beyond what's otherwise available in one place. A hunch is that eventually the data will grow to around 2500 - 3000 talks.

Several categories of talks (labeled '**series**' in the data) are included, e.g.:

+ Cosmologists talking about their recent papers (e.g., [Cosmology Talks hosted by Shaun Hotchkiss](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCstdttIo3HM6h3hDk_v2hug/videos), [Cosmology from Home](https://www.cosmologyfromhome.com/))
+ Lectures (e.g., summer schools etc, such as those offered by [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it/programmes/career-development.aspx))
+ Conference talks (e.g., [ESO H0 2020](https://www.eso.org/sci/meetings/2020/H0.html), [TeVPA](https://indico.cern.ch/event/828038/), [Neutrino 2020](https://conferences.fnal.gov/nu2020/))
+ Talks sponsored by academic or other institutions (e.g., [KIPAC](), [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/sf-events/simons-foundation-lectures/), etc)
+ Collected talks by individuals (e.g., [Risa Wechsler](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL93BCCE8FAC40EBD5))
+ Miscellaneous departmental seminars, colloquia, workshops, etc (e.g., [KICP Colloquia](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCejbBNzH6AfWNwg5V_AQGlg/videos))

Where a series includes some talks that are not cosmology related, those non-cosmology talks are generally  not listed here.

[Datasette](https://datasette.io/) is the open-source tool used to build the database and web app and publish the data. It was created by [Simon Willison](simonwillison.net) ([github repo](https://github.com/simonw/datasette), [@simonw](https://twitter.com/simonw) on twitter). Many thanks to Simon for making this excellent tool available - it's a great match for this project and also especially for projects utilizing SQLite database files.

The source code for this app is on GitHub [in this repo](https://github.com/jermity/cosmotalks-datasette).
