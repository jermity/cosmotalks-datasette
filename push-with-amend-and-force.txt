How to push to a repo to maintain only one commit – useful if you would otherwise have a whole bunch of data-hogging commits that aren't necessary to keep. From simonw: The latest til.db file is now stored in https://github.com/simonw/til-db – every time I push a new copy of the file there I use 

git commit --amend 

to rewrite history followed by 

git push --force

so that repo only ever contains a single commit which is the commit that added the file.
